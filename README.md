                                    ** First Capstone Project for Merit America **
Worked in a team of 4 developers to create a backend java program that displays and allows users to insert virtual money and purchase various snacks through the command-line. 
I was in charge of logging transactions and generating sales reports. 
Also, I contributed to writing tests cases ensuring our product worked seamlessly. 
Me & my team went beyond the scope of the project by implementing our own ASCII art to add to the aesthetic of the command-line since there is no front-end to the application.
We wanted to create a program that paid homage to our favorite snacks growing up so we've adjusted the names of the the given products as well.
This is a project that was rather simple to make yet would've been only a dream had you asked me to write code for it 5 years ago!
